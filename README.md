Daily Algorithm

Day 3 A

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
Example 3:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25


Day 3 B
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
